# Automatic construction of a german medical knowledge graph using LLMs
The rapid expansion of published medical research presents a significant challenge for healthcare practitioners and clinicians, who must balance demanding daily tasks with staying updated on the latest scientific advancements in their field [^2] [^3]. Open databases like PubMed help address this issue by collecting, storing, and maintaining an ever-growing body of biomedical knowledge. Although healthcare professionals use PubMed to find up-to-date answers to questions arising in their practice, the sheer volume of over 1 million new publications annually makes extracting relevant information time-consuming [^1]. As a result, many questions that cannot be answered within three minutes are often neglected, potentially disadvantaging the affected patients [^4].
